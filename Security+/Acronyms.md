IAM
- identity and access management (IAM) system ensure the proper creation of accounts and their associated permissions.

LDAP 
- Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) would be one portion of a complete IAM system. 

TPM
- The Trusted Platform Module (TPM) chip holds the cryptographic secrets and hardware state to help secure an encrypted hard drive.

PKI
- Public key infrastructure (PKI) refers to a framework of Certificate Authorities (CAs), digital certificates, software, services, and other cryptographic components deployed to validate subject identities.
CSR
- The Certificate Signing Request (CSR) is a file containing the information that the subject wants to use in the certificate, including its public key.

SAML
- _Security Assertion Markup Language (SAML_) is an open standard that allows identity providers (IdP) to pass authorization credentials to service providers (SP).

MAC
 - Security clearance levels form the basis of **mandatory access control** (MAC). Rather than defining access control lists (ACLs) on resources, each object receives a classification label. Depending on the clearance level, a subject receives access to that resource.

IPSec
- Internet Protocol Security (IPSec) provides confidentiality, sender authentication, and message integrity by functioning at the network level.

NGFM
- While a traditional firewall typically provides stateful inspection of incoming and outgoing network traffic, a next-generation firewall includes additional features like application awareness and control, integrated intrusion prevention, and cloud-delivered threat intelligence
- Part of a Unified Threat Management (UTM) including network intrusion prevention system (IPS)

EAP
- The Extensible Authentication Protocol (EAP) provides a framework for deploying multiple types of authentication methods.
- The Extensible Authentication Protocol (EAP) performs smart-card authentication without a password.

ZTA
- Zero Trust Architecture 

RTOS
- Real-Time Operation System

SAN
- Storage Area Network

MTD
- Maximum tolerable downtime 

RAID
- redundant array of independant disks - combines multiple physical disk drives into one logical unit for the purpose of data redundancy

BCP
- Business Continuity Planning - pinpoints the most important parts of your business, identifies potential risks to these critical pieces and prepares you to recover as quick and easy as possible.

DPO
- Data Protection Officer

COOP
- Continuity of operations planning

SCAP
- The security content automation protocol (SCAP) and common vulnerabilities and exposures (CVE) set standards to create a unified language for identifying and communicating software application vulnerabilities.

NAC
- Network Access Control By evaluating the operating system version, patch level, antivirus status, or the presence of specific security software, NAC ensures that devices meet a minimum set of security standards before being granted network access.

SAE
- Simultaneous authentication of equals - SAE is a feature of WPA3 that replaces the pre-shared key (PSK) exchange protocol in WPA2. SAE ensures attackers cannot intercept the Wi-Fi password even if they intercept the login.

DDP
- Wi-Fi Easy Connect, also known as Device Provisioning Protocol (DPP), replaces Wi-Fi Protected Setup. It uses quick response (QR) codes or near-field communication (NFC) tags to communicate public keys between devices.

TPM
- Trusted Platform Module (TPM). The TPM chip has a secure storage area to which a disk encryption program, such as Windows BitLocker, can write its keys.
