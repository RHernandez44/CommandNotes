##### Cyber Kill Chain
Designed in 2011 by Lockheed Martin and named for the "kill chains" military planners use to define the necessary steps of attacking a target. It describes each attack as a linear seven-step chain of attacker actions. By breaking the chain, you can stop the attack

##### The Diamond Model of Intrusion Analysis
Designed in 2013 by the Center for Cyber Intelligence Analysis and Threat Research. The Diamond Model describes attacks as the interaction between adversaries, victims, capabilities, and infrastructure mapped out as a diamond; instead of charting the sequence of individual attacks, it provides insight into an attackerâ€™s methods and motivations. Defensively, you can use it to identify ways to make adversaries less willing or able to move on their victims.

##### MITRE ATT&CK
Adversarial Tactics, Techniques, and Common Knowledge was designed in 2015 by the MITRE Corporation to model overall adversary behaviors. It incorporates a process-based model like the Cyber Kill Chain, but in addition to a less rigid order of operations, it uses an attack matrix accounting for adversary techniques. The additional level of detail gives it a more tactical focus than the Kill Chain.
