## Risk measurement

- Quantitative risk assessment assigns an objective value, typically a monetary figure, to each risk based on the probability and impact cost of the associated threat. It can give a clear cost-benefit analysis for a given security control, but itâ€™s only accurate when you can determine a clear and concrete cost for each potential impact.

- Qualitative risk assessment also begins with the probability and impact cost of each threat, but instead of monetary values, it uses ***human*** judgment to calculate and assign a priority to the associated risk. By its nature, qualitative risk assessment is inexact and subject to the biases and areas of expertise of whoever is doing the analysis. Still, it can work even for assets and impacts with intangible costs.
