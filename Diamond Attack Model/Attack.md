Adversary

In our exciting storyline, we have discovered a suspected insider threat causing trouble within the Best Festival Company and interfering with the proposed merger with AntarctiCrafts. This individual, who we'll call the **adversary operator**, is not just an ordinary troublemaker. They are the clever attackers or malicious threat actors responsible for cyberattacks or intrusions. Adversary operators can be an individual or an entire organisation aiming to disrupt the operations of another.  

That's not the only type of adversary. The **adversary customer** is another intriguing player in this grand scheme. They are the one who reaps the rewards from the cyberattack and can consolidate the efforts of various adversary operators.

Picture this: a collection of adversaries working together to orchestrate widespread security breaches, just like the enigmatic [advanced persistent threat (APT)](https://csrc.nist.gov/glossary/term/advanced_persistent_threat) groups.

### Victim

This is none other than the target of the adversary's wicked intentions. It could be a single individual or domain or an entire organisation with multiple network and data assets. The Best Festival Company finds itself at the mercy of these adversaries, and we must shield them from further harm.

### Infrastructure

Every adversary needs tools. They require software or hardware to execute their malicious objectives. Infrastructure represents the physical and logical interconnections that an adversary employs. Our story takes an interesting twist as we uncover the USB drive that Tracy McGreedy cunningly plugged in, disrupting Santa's meticulously crafted plans.

But beware. Adversarial infrastructure can be owned and controlled by adversaries or even intermediaries like service providers.

### Capability

Ah, what capabilities these adversaries have; what skills, tools, and techniques they employ!

Here, we shine a light on the tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) that shape adversaries' devious endeavours. Intruders or adversaries may employ various tactics, techniques, and procedures for malicious activities. Some examples include:

- **Phishing:** Adversaries may use deceptive emails or messages to trick individuals into revealing sensitive information or clicking on malicious links.
- **Exploiting vulnerabilities:** Adversaries can exploit weaknesses or vulnerabilities in software, systems, or networks to gain unauthorised access or perform malicious actions. This was very well showcased on AOC Day 10, where we covered SQL injection as one of the techniques used.
- **Social engineering:** This involves manipulating individuals through psychological tactics to gain unauthorised access or obtain confidential information.
- **Malware attacks:** Adversaries may deploy malicious software, such as viruses, worms, or ransomware, to gain control over systems or steal data.
- **Insider threat:** This refers to individuals within an organisation who misuse their access privileges to compromise systems, steal data, or disrupt operations.
- **Denial–of–service (DoS) Attacks:** Adversaries may overwhelm a target system or network with excessive traffic or requests, causing it to become unresponsive or crash.
