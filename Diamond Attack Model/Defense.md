But fear not, for we shall not be mere observers in this cosmic battle! We will harness the power of the Diamond Model's components, particularly capability and infrastructure, for our defensive endeavours. We will forge The Best Festival Company into a formidable defender – no longer a hapless victim.

### Defensive Capability

It is said that defence is the best offence. In the quest for protection against adversaries, the Best Festival Company must equip itself with powerful defensive capabilities. Two key elements of this are threat hunting and vulnerability management.

**Threat hunting** is a proactive and iterative process, led by skilled security professionals, to actively search for signs of malicious activities or security weaknesses within the organisation's network and systems. Organisations can detect adversaries early in their attack lifecycle by conducting regular threat hunts. Threat hunters analyse behavioural patterns, identify advanced threats, and improve incident response. Developing predefined hunting playbooks and fostering collaboration among teams ensures a systematic and efficient approach to threat hunting.

**Vulnerability management** is a structured process of identifying, assessing, prioritising, mitigating, and monitoring vulnerabilities in an organisation's systems and applications. Regular vulnerability scanning helps identify weaknesses that adversaries could exploit. Prioritising vulnerabilities based on their severity and potential impact, promptly patching or remediating vulnerabilities, and maintaining an up–to–date asset inventory is essential. Continuous monitoring, integration with threat intelligence feeds, and periodic penetration testing further strengthen the organisation's security posture. Meanwhile, reporting and accountability provide visibility into security efforts.

By integrating threat hunting and vulnerability management, organisations can proactively defend against adversaries, detect threats early, and reduce the attack surface. These defensive capabilities form a solid foundation for incident response and ensure the best possible defence for the Best Festival Company.

### Defensive Infrastructure

The Best Festival Company will construct their bastion of defence, fortified with tools and infrastructure to repel cyber-attacks. Layer upon layer of hardware and software will be deployed, ranging from intrusion defence and prevention systems to robust anti-malware solutions. The objective is to impede attackers by limiting their options to predetermined paths and disrupting their malicious actions with increased noise.

This strategy serves as a deterrent to the attacker, making it more difficult for them to carry out their intended activities and providing an opportunity for detection and response. By implementing this approach, organisations can strengthen their cyber security posture and reduce the risk of successful attacks.
